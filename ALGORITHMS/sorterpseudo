#1. Name:
#      Carlos Lespin
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 06: Sort Design
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      This program is meant to open a file determined by the user and sort all the elements
#      inside that file.        
# 4. Algorithmic Efficiency
#      This is code has an efficiency of  O(n^2); because it contains two loops inside each other. Both loops
#      visit each element in the array.
# 5. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      Even though it's a short program, the hardest part was making it all makes sense.
        I know it defeats the purpose of writing the pseudocode, but I had to code it python first
        to understand it all better.
# 6. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      2 hours



#Prepare the file and list that will be used to find the word.

PROMPT user for file_name
OPEN array_file
READ element_list as lines from array_file


PUT element_list

for i_pivot in range(len(element_list)-1, 0, -1):

    for index in range(i_pivot):
        if list[index] > list[index + 1]:

            list[index], list[index + 1] = list[index + 1], list[index]

PUT element_list


"array": [ "52", "26", "39", "15" ]
